# JacquelinemWebsite
A website about me. If you want to get to know me here's a great place to start.
# Personal Website

This is my personal website created as part of block 9.

## Contents

- `index.html`: The homepage of my website.
- `about.html`: A page detailing information about me.

- `portfolio.html`: A showcase of my projects and work experiences.
- `style.css`: Contains all the styling for the website. There are at least 3 css pages . Since Im still not very good at coding and tend to add alot of spacing to keep myself organized. I thought it better to break up long pages into multiples

- `javascript.js`: Contains JavaScript functions and interactions for the website.

## Features

- Personalized content including text and images.
- Basic CSS styling.
- A simple JavaScript function that logs a greeting message to the console.

## Usage

To view the website, simply open th pages in the files or web browser

## Contributing

This is a personal project so I am the only contributer , feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
I tend to overthink so all suggestions and contructive critics are much needed.
